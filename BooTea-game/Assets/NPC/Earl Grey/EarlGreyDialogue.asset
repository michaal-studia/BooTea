  dialogueLines:
  - Ah, what have we here? A charming little establishment for spirits like myself?
    How intriguing.
  - Welcome to the tea shop! What brings you in today?
  - "Ah, how delightful\u2026"
  - "It\u2019s been so long since I\u2019ve found myself in a tea room, much less
    one as cozy and inviting as this one."
  - I must say, I am quite taken with the atmosphere. You have a charming little
    hut here.
  - "I\u2019m glad you like it! Can I offer you a cup of tea?"
  - "Tea\u2026"
  - "Yes, yes, of course. How could I resist such a fine invitation? I must admit,
    I\u2019ve been longing for a proper brew\u2026 Perhaps something with a hint
    of the past\u2026"
  - Ah, but I suppose I should introduce myself first.
  - "Earl Grey, at your service young lady, though I must warn you, I\u2019ve been
    known to be quite particular when it comes to my tea."
  - Earl Grey? Like the tea?
  - Quite so!
  - You see, this blend is quite dear to me. It is, in fact, my own creation. A story,
    if you will, of discovery and serendipity.
  - "I\u2019d love to hear your story!"
  - "Ah, well then\u2026 It all began one evening, as I sat with a cup of my favorite
    black tea\u2026"
  - "My maid has prepared it, as she always did - perfectly timed, perfectly steeped.
    But on this occasion, something in the air was different\u2026"
  - "I looked out the window and saw a rare flower blooming in the garden, its fragrance
    was just exquisite\u2026"
  - I had the most curious idea - what would it be like, I wondered, to blend that
    delicate scent with my tea?
  - Did you try it? How was it?
  - "The result\u2026"
  - "was extraordinary. It was a marriage of tradition and a new discovery, and I,
    in my infinite wisdom, decided to name it after myself. Earl Grey. Quite fitting,
    wouldn\u2019t you say?"
  - "I\u2019ve always loved Earl Grey tea, but I have to admit, I usually just buy
    the blend from the store. It\u2019s so easy that way."
  - "Hmm\u2026 You store-bought it, did you?"
  - "While I can appreciate the convenience of such things, I must confess, it does
    irk me just a tad. You see, back in my day, there was a certain art to brewing
    a proper cup of Earl Grey. It wasn\u2019t even simply about adding a floral essence
    to some already prepared leaves."
  - No, no, my dear. The true essence of the blend - the heart of it - was in the
    balance, the careful infusion, done with love and precision. It was an experience,
    not an afterthought.
  - I never thought about it that way. So, how would you make it properly?
  - "Ah, yes, the proper way\u2026"
  - First and foremost, you must select a good, strong black tea - a fine English
    breakfast, perhaps, though one can experiment if one feels particularly adventurous.
  - Next, you must acquire the freshest bergamot oil, distilled to perfection. The
    oil should be blended carefully - not simply sprayed or added haphazardly. But
    the when is important here.
  - You must properly mix the oil into the leaves before adding them into the water.
    Not after, mind you, for the oil must be allowed to steep with the leaves, so
    as to not overwhelm them.
  - "Now, here\u2019s where the art comes in. The water temperature, my dear, is
    key. You want it to be just below boiling - about 93C - to avoid burning the
    delicate leaves. Too hot, and you\u2019ll ruin the balance. Too cold, and the
    flavor won\u2019t be properly extracted."
  - So, not boiling water?
  - Precisely! Boiling water is far too harsh for such a refined tea.
  - Now, once the water is ready, pour it gently over the leaves, allowing them to
    swirl and infuse for about 4 minutes. You want the tea to steep just enough to
    release its full-bodied richness, without becoming bitter.
  - "That\u2019s a lot more careful than I thought!"
  - "Indeed, my dear. You must show the tea the respect it deserves - only then will
    you unlock its true potential. When done correctly, you\u2019ll have a cup that
    is rich, refined, and oh, so satisfying."
  - "Now, why don\u2019t you try making a cup for me, my dear? I do believe it\u2019s
    time for a proper tasting."
